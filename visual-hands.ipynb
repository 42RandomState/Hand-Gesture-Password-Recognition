The system starts by detecting my face to enable the password input phase. Then, I use my left hand to input a sequence of hand gestures (for example, 1, 2, 3, 4), which acts as my password. If I make a mistake, I can use my right hand to delete the last gesture. The system verifies the entered gesture sequence and either grants or denies access, showing a message and saving a screenshot accordingly. It also limits the number of login attempts for added security. Everything works in real-time through the webcam interface.**\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **ATTENTION!!** This code dosen't work on kaggle, you can download the
